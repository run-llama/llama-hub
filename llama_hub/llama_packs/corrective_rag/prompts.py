    Evaluation Criteria:
    - Consider whether the document contains keywords or topics related to the user's question.
    - The evaluation should not be overly stringent; the primary objective is to identify and filter out clearly irrelevant retrievals.

    Decision:
    - Assign a binary score to indicate the document's relevance.
    - Use 'yes' if the document is relevant to the question, or 'no' if it is not.

    Please provide your binary score ('yes' or 'no') below to indicate the document's relevance to the user question."""
